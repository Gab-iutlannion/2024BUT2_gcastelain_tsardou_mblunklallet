            404 Error - Page Not Found </p>

         <h3>  <br> Uh-oh! It looks like you’ve taken a wrong turn or stumbled upon a page that’s gone missing. <br><br>Just like a needle in a haystack or a sock lost in the dryer, the page you’re looking for has vanished into the digital abyss. But don’t worry, it’s not the end of the world—or the internet!

             <h3>
            This could be due to a few reasons:
             <br>

            •	The page was moved or deleted: Sometimes, we tidy up our site to keep things fresh and functional. If the page existed before, it might have been removed or relocated.
             <br>
             •	A broken link: It’s possible that a link directed you here in error. That happens more often than you’d think!
             <br>
             •	A mistyped URL: Double-check the URL in your browser. A single letter or symbol out of place can send you on a wild goose chase.

             •	Did you know the first 404 error page appeared in the 1980s when the internet was still in its infancy? It’s been a staple ever since!
             <br>
             •	The term “404” was reportedly named after Room 404 at CERN, where the original web team worked.
             <br>
             •	Many websites have creative 404 pages—some even have games or funny animations. Ours might not be quite so flashy, but we’re just as friendly!
